Contamination, Injection Injury, Hydraulic Brakes Have a Higher Braking Force, Hydraulic Systems Make the Most Sense and Are Recommended, Air Brakes Are Used in Heavy Commercial Vehicles Due to Their Reliability, Complex Installation and Maintenance, Places Where Residential Neighborhoods Are Near the Interstate or Toll Roads, You Engage Your Brakes Just Hard Enough That You Barely Feel Your Weight Starting to Shift in Your Handlebars,  but Not Enough for It to Start Placing Additional Strain on Your Hands, A Water Molecule is Very Stable, Forcing Brake Fluid Throughout the Brake Lines Into the Caliper Pistons, They Also Require Maintenance, Its Legal, Air Brakes, Hydraulic Brakes, A Traditional Type of Rim Brake Commonly Found on Many Bicycles, All Cars Do Use Hydraulic Pressure in Their Brake Systems, To Help Stop the Truck Faster in Addition to the Traditional Friction Brakes on the Wheels, Lower Cost and Less Complexity, The Supply of Air is Unlimited,  So the Brake System Can Never Run Out of Its Operating Fluid,  as Hydraulic Brakes Can, They Don't Need All the Extra Weight and Complexity of a Modern Air Brake System, To Bend Sheet Metal, The Panel Bender Also Has a
